## Task description

1. Convert the initial table to the First Normal Form.

    </figure>
  </p>

2. Convert the new tables to the Second Normal Form.

3. Convert the new tables to the Third Normal Form.

4. Design an ER diagram for the resulting tables.
   Use clear and specific names for entities and attributes. Specify data types for the attributes. Ensure that all relationships and attributes have clear and understandable cardinalities and values.

5. Using the ER diagram, create the tables in the database. 
   Design these tables without specific values, considering only the columns and their relationships, either manually or automatically.

## Task goals

* Master the technique of converting data into normalized forms to ensure its efficiency and consistency.
* Understand how to identify and model entities and their relationships, which is crucial for the proper organization of information in a database.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Attached link to the repository with name `goit-rdb-hw-02` and the repository files as an archive.
2. The table has been normalized to 1NF.
3. The table has been normalized to 2NF.
4. The table has been normalized to 3NF.
    ðŸ’¡ The result of the table normalization can be in any form/format (Google Doc, Google Sheets, etc.).
5. An ER diagram of the resulting tables has been created. The diagram should correspond to the normalized tables.
   ðŸ’¡ There should be several tables with relationships between them. The result can be in the form of a file and/or a screenshot.
6. Clear and specific names for entities and attributes have been used. Data types for attributes have been specified. All relationships and attributes have clear and understandable cardinalities and values.
7. Tables have been created in the database (only tables and columns considering relationships) either manually or automatically.
    ðŸ’¡ The result should be in the form of a screenshot of the deployed schema in Workbench.
8. Number the screenshots to easily understand to which task stage each one relates to. For example, if a file corresponds to step 3, its name should begin like this: p3_.
9. Uploaded screenshots as an archive. The archive name should be in the format HW2_LastName_FirstName.
